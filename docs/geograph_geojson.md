# GeoGraph as GeoJSON

This document describes an informal extension to [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) 
in order to support reading/writing networkx-based GeoGraph objects.

## Rationale

A single-file, intermediate format for representing a GeoGraph was needed to 
facilitate transfer between tools.  In choosing a format, the following were priorities:

1.  Single file

2.  Explicit linkages between nodes and edges to eliminate "fuzziness" when joining them

3.  Widespread support (i.e. format converters and renderers)

With a minor extension to support priority 2, GeoJSON fits the bill.  Regarding point 2, [MapBox](https://github.com/mapbox) has many tools to support GeoJSON (see [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)).  GeoJSON can also be rendered natively by github.  

The following are some downsides to the chosen representation:

1.  Verbose, making it expensive to transfer/store (Compression or [geobuf](https://github.com/mapbox/geobuf) may help)

2.  Streaming may be difficult since the edges depend on the existence of
    the nodes (If required, bundling nodes with their edges may help)

## Approach

We extend GeoJSON to support the notion of a graph by adding attributes to
a feature that allows them to be interpreted as a `node` or an `edge`.  
At this point, only `Point` features can be considered nodes and only 
`LineString` features can be considered edges.  

A Node is indicated by a `node_id` property.
An Edge is indicated by a `node_from` and `node_to` properties 
(each reference a `node_id`).  

This can be best seen with an example:

```
{ 
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": 
    [
        { 
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": 
            {
                "type": "Point", 
                "coordinates": [0.0, 0.0]
            },
            "properties": 
            {
                "node_id": "0",
                "name": "node-0"
            }
        },
        { 
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": 
            {
                "type": "Point", 
                "coordinates": [0.5, 0.5]
            },
            "properties": 
            {
                "node_id": "1",
                "name": "node-1"
            }
        },
        { 
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "LineString",
                "coordinates": [
                    [0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5]
                ]
            },
            "properties": {
                "name": "edge-0"
                "node_from": "0",
                "node_to": "1"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The above represents a GeoGraph with a single edge (named 'edge-0') whose
'from' node has 'node_id' == '0' (named 'node-0') and 'to' node has 
'node_id' == '1' (named 'node-1'). 

Note that the geometry of an edge is distinct from the nodes it connects.  

Issue:  Should we add a unique namespace to distinguish 
node_id, node_from and node_to? 

## Future

It may become useful to consider a `Polygon` as a `node` (e.g. cities with 
area and shape) connected by some `Relation` (non-geometric) type as an `edge`
(e.g. a category describing the city).  The approach taken here allows for 
this flexibility (though the GeoGraph implementation would need to be updated
to support this).
