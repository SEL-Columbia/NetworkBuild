NetworkBuild
============

An alternative algorithm for building an optimized infastructure network using nearest foreign neighbor queries.

This algorithm reduces the space complexity currently required in Network Planner by only considering edges between 
nearest foreign neighbors. This is made possible by a recursive space partitioning data structure offering cheap 
lookups in sublinear time. The core MST algorithm is largely influenced by Boruvka Meets Nearest Neighbors [1].


Spatial Index

Nodal coordinates are stored in a KDTree for efficient k-nearest neighbor lookups. Due to the periodicity in geodetic coordinate systems, the points are first projected into 3D cartesian space to preserve adjacency.
